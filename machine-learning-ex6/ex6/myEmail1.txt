We have done this event for YOU, our fans as well as passionate and smart people from all around the world. Please help us to evaluate our „first one“ and potentially improve the FC Bayern HackDays by filling out this short questionnaire.
 
And further more please be a bit patient with us. During the next weeks we will evaluate and discuss all presentations as well as potential next steps with regards to some of the submitted solutions. We promise to be in touch soon!
 
In order to continue our dialogue we have also created a (closed group) for FC Bayern HackDays Alumnis on LinkedIn here.

Stay tuned and hope to see you all soon!
